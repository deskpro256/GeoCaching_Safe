# GeoCachingSafe

This is an electronics project that I am doing with my colleague.
The idea is that there is a safe hidden somewhere, but to access it, you need a code.
The code is hidden in location A, the safe is at location B.
The GeoCache consists of these two items. First you find the code, which leads you to the safe.

This device is the control panel for the safe lock.
Also, the device uses a PCB from another project of mine, which I made for Kinectics Professional Nails Systems.
